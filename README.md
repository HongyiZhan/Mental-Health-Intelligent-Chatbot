Welcome to the MindTalk Chatbot! This project is not just about offering support for mental health concerns; it's a gateway to leveraging cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) for analyzing complex issues related to AI ethics and justice. Our chatbot, powered by Python and the OpenAI API, provides a warm, confidential space where users can engage in meaningful conversations, access information, and seek assistance without fear of judgment. What sets MindTalk apart is its ability to store conversation data on Azure, allowing the chatbot to recall and provide continuity in user interactions, enabling a more holistic approach to addressing mental health and AI ethics.

Here's to a supportive, empathetic, and technologically advanced platform for discussing mental health and exploring the ever-evolving landscape of AI ethics. https://hongyizhan.github.io/Mental-Health-Intelligent-Chatbot/

## Project Overview

Mental health is a critical and often stigmatized topic. This project aims to provide a safe and accessible platform for users to discuss their mental health concerns while also advancing the field of AI ethics through Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot uses the OpenAI API to generate responses and interact with users in a natural and empathetic manner. 

### Features

- OpenAI integration for intelligent responses.
- Azure storage for conversation history.
- User-friendly HTML web interface for chatting.
- A safe and non-judgmental space for users to talk about mental health.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed
- An OpenAI API key
- An Azure account for data storage
- An HTML web server

### Innovative Workflow

The core innovation of our project lies in its workflow, which is meticulously crafted to provide a tailored and continuously evolving experience for our users:

1. **User Identification**: 
   - A user clicks on the chatbot link and is led to a login page.
   - The user enters a unique identifier assigned to them during the initial session.

2. **Engaging Conversation**: 
   - Once logged in, the user proceeds to the chat page to start a conversation with the chatbot.

3. **Data Retention**: 
   - After the initial chat session, the user finishes the conversation.

4. **Session Continuity**: 
   - When the user returns to the link after several days have passed, a repeatable session is initiated.
   - The user is led back to the login page and enters their unique identifier from the initial session.

5. **Personalized Experience**: 
   - Based on the identifier, the chatbot "remembers" the conversation from the past for that specific user.
   - The chatbot leverages this historical data to generate a new conversation, often with follow-up questions based on the prior chat.
